             * A hero and villain are locked in a battle, and we need to figure out who will win.
             *
             * Below is a for loop where we need to implement our battle between our hero and the villain.
             * Here ar the rules:
             * 1. The hero attacks first then the villain.
             * 2. If either the hero or villain's hitpoints drops below 0 the battle is over.
             * 3. Once the battle has ended, use the output(name, hitpoints) function to output the victors name and their current hitpoints.
             *
             * You will need to use the following statements:
             * 1. IF
             * 2. BREAK
